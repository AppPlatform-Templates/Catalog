# NOT OFFICIAL. DO NOT USE

# Template Submission Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the DigitalOcean App Platform Templates catalog! This guide explains how to submit templates to the catalog.

## Two Ways to Contribute

### 1. Official Templates (Hosted in AppPlatform-Templates org)

Official templates are maintained by DigitalOcean and trusted contributors. They undergo thorough review and become part of the officially supported collection.

**Best for:**
- Core templates (common frameworks, databases)
- Templates you want DigitalOcean to maintain long-term
- Reference implementations

**Process:** See [Official Template Submission](#official-template-submission) below

### 2. Community Templates (Hosted in your account)

Community templates remain in your GitHub account. You maintain ownership and are responsible for updates. The catalog links to your repository.

**Best for:**
- Specialized use cases
- Your company's stack
- Experimental or niche templates
- When you want to keep ownership

**Process:** See [Community Template Submission](#community-template-submission) below
